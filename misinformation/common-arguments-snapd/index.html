       <h1>
          Snaps are slow to launch
      </h1>
      
       <p>
         Snaps creates a virtual device for itself which it uses, this process takes some cycles.
Opening a snap after should not take much longer.
Snaps being slower to launch is matterless as most packages shipped in Snaps are not constantly cycled for maximum throughput.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Snaps are bloated 
      </h1>
      <p>
        Given you only care for possible overhead with dependencies and virtual drives yes, snaps using that comparison are bloated.
But that's the wrong system to deploy them on anyway, what snaps offer in return far outweight the minor kicks in memory usage.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Snaps don't share GTK themes
      </h1>
      <p>
        Being able to read a GTK theme from a user is in some cases undesirable for the developer and potentially the user
As themes are the, if not the biggest UI breaking factor in any graphical environment which supports it.
The user is able to change this hence the overall effect is practically none.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Snaps are proprietary
      </h1>
      <p>
        No part of the snap client is proprietary, this confusion arises from the snapstore being proprietary. 
      </p>
      <h1>
        Snap offers no benefits to normal style package managing
      </h1>
      <p>
        No, Snap offers the exact opposite. 
Snap offers a way of building and shipping packages in a self dependant package format which dosen't interfere with the rest of the system components.
This by consequence eliminates one of the bigger problems in package management which is dependency resolving and managing.
Packages hence are much less prone to breakage by a system update/etc.
Snap offers a reproducible way to build packages.
