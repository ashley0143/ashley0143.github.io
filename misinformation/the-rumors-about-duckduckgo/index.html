      <h3 class="c1">Ashley's Personal site - Misinformation bout ddg</h3>
 
      <a href="/misinformation">Go back</a>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Recently, There was alots (like, alot) of misinformation about DuckDuckGo, the privacy first search engine.
      </p>
      <p>
        It all starts in febuary, with Gabriel's tweet about "how ddg is down-ranking the russian misinformations". The people who use ddg <b>thought that they were <a href="https://youtu.be/OjWDfIpwEAQ">Censored the results.</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        They simply dont.<sup>1</sup>
         They aren't ranking based on any political agenda or my (or anyone else's) personal political opinions. They are also not assessing any individual news stories.<sup>1</sup>

      <h1>
        About bing / microsoft stuff
      </h1>
      <p>
        9to5mac.com made an article about how duckduckgo is giving permission to bing trackers. <sup>2</sup><br>
        and alots, like lots of ppl thinked that duckduckgo is becoming un-trustworty. they think the search engine <b>was</b> a "spyware". they are not a "spyware", and that article is about the mobile app, not the search engine.
        the DuckDuckGo CEO, Gabriel wrote a comment about it on reddit. 
      </p>
      <code>Hi, I'm the CEO and Founder of DuckDuckGo. To be clear (since I already see confusion in the comments), when you <br>load our search results, you are anonymous, including ads. Also on 3rd-party websites we actually do block Microsoft 3rd-party <br>cookies in our browsers plus more protections including fingerprinting protection. That is, this article is not about our search<br> engine, but about our browsers -- we have browsers (really all-in-one privacy apps) for iOS, Android, and now Mac (in beta).<br><br>

When most other browsers on the market talk about tracking protection they are usually referring to 3rd-party cookie protection <br>and fingerprinting protection, and our browsers impose these same restrictions on all third-party tracking scripts, <br>including those from Microsoft. We also have a lot of other above-and-beyond web protections that also apply to Microsoft <br>scripts (and everyone else), e.g., Global Privacy Control, first-party cookie expiration, referrer header trimming, new cookie consent handling (in our Mac beta), fire button (one-click) data clearing, and more.<br><br>

What this article is talking about specifically is another above-and-beyond protection that most browsers don't even attempt to <br>do for web protection— stopping third-party tracking scripts from even loading on third-party websites -- because this can <br>easily cause websites to break. But we've taken on that challenge because it makes for better privacy, and faster downloads <br>-- we wrote a blog post about it here. Because we're doing this above-and-beyond protection where we can, and offer many other unique protections (e.g., Google AMP/FLEDGE/Topics protection, automatic HTTPS upgrading, tracking protection for *other* apps in Android, email protection to block trackers for emails sent to your regular inbox, etc.), users get way more privacy protection with our app than they would using other browsers. Our goal has always been to provide the most privacy we can in one download.<br><br>

The issue at hand is, while most of our protections like 3rd-party cookie blocking apply to Microsoft scripts on 3rd-party sites <br>(again, this is off of DuckDuckGo,com, i.e., not related to search), we are currently contractually restricted by Microsoft<br> from completely stopping them from loading (the one above-and-beyond protection explained in the last paragraph)<br> on 3rd party sites. We still restrict them though (e.g., no 3rd party cookies allowed). The original example was Workplace.com loading a LinkedIn.com script. Nevertheless, we have been and are working with Microsoft as we speak to reduce or remove this limited restriction.<br><br>

I understand this is all rather confusing because it is a search syndication contract that is preventing us from doing a non-search thing. That's because our product is a bundle of multiple privacy protections, and this is a distribution requirement imposed on us as part of the search syndication agreement that helps us privately use some Bing results to provide you with better private search results overall. While a lot of what you see on our results page privately incorporates content from other sources, including our own indexes (e.g., Wikipedia, Local listings, Sports, etc.), we source most of our traditional links and images privately from Bing (though because of other search technology our link and image results still may look different). Really only two companies (Google and Microsoft) have a high-quality global web link index (because I believe it costs upwards of a billion dollars a year to do), and so literally every other global search engine needs to bootstrap with one or both of them to provide a mainstream search product. The same is true for maps btw -- only the biggest companies can similarly afford to put satellites up and send ground cars to take streetview pictures of every neighborhood.<br><br>

Anyway, I hope this provides some helpful context. Taking a step back, I know our product is not perfect and will never be. Nothing can provide 100% protection. And we face many constraints: platform constraints (we can't offer all protections on every platform do to limited APIs or other restrictions), limited contractual constraints (like in this case), breakage constraints (blocking some things totally breaks web experiences), and of course the evolving tracking arms race that we constantly work to keep ahead of. That's why we have always been extremely careful to never promise anonymity when browsing outside our search engine, because that frankly isn’t possible. We're also working on updates to our app store descriptions to make this more clear. Holistically though I believe what we offer is the best thing out there for mainstream users who want simple privacy protection without breaking things, and that is our product vision.<pre>3</pre></code>
