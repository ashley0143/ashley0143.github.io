        The "metaverse" is *<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/25/ive-seen-the-metaverse-and-i-dont-want-it">another place to spend money on things</a>, except in
   this place the empty promise that buying stuff will make you happy
   is left even more exposed by the fact that the things in question
   do not physically exist.*
      </p>
<p>
The article informs us that Facebook is thinking about ways to track
and profile people in its metaverse even more than they are tracked in
the physical world.
      </p>
      <p>
Facebook requires useds to use their 'real' (the name they normally go
by as defined by Facebook) on the site or risk having their accounts
suspended.
</p>
<p>
Facebook is not your friend.  Its 'real name' policy is enough reason
to refuse to let it use you, but there is so much more nastiness in Facebook.
<p>Even as Facebook oppresses real useds with its "real name" requirement, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/heres-how-easy-it-is-to-buy-fake-facebook-profiles">it is easy to buy and run a realistic Facebook account</a> that is completely fake.</p>
</p>
    <p>
Facebook spontaneously asked its useds questions
<a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-snitch-on-friends-that-arent-using-real-names/">
trying to expose
  useds who had not given their real names</a>.</p>
    <p>
      if you have something to add,lemme know!
