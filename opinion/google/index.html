      <p>
        Do not use google.       
In general, most Google services require
running nonfree Javascript code If you refuse to run that (for instance,
by running LibreJS), you'll see that you should not use those
services. <br> <br> Google stores a list of all purchases a user has made that in any way mention the user's a gmail account. A user can delete purchases from this list, but only one purchase at a time. Then that purchase disappears from the list that the user sees. Whether it remains in another list, we do not know, but I'd expect Google to answer that question with doubletalk. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Google censored installation of Samsung's <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/03/google-pulls-ad-blocking-app-for-samsung-phones">ad-blocker,</a> saying that blocking ads is "interference" with the sites that advertise (and surveil users through ads).
      </p>
<p>The ad-blocker is proprietary software, just like the program
(Google Play) that Google used to deny access to install it.  I would
refuse to have either of them on my
computer.  <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">Using
a nonfree program</a> gives the owner power over you, and Google has
exercised that power.
