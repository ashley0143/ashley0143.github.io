  Spotify flaunts how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/01/spotify-wrapped-is-free-advertising-that-says-nothing-about-the-joy-of-music">it tracks what each user listens to, and invites users
  to boast about Spotify's knowledge of them</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This devious scheme is all the more vicious because it operates at an
  emotional level which most the manipulated victims can't even recognize
  as manipulation.
Like most "music screaming" dis-services, Spotify is based on
proprietary malware (DRM and snooping).  Recently it
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/21/spotify-faces-user-backlash-over-new-privacy-policy">
demanded users
submit to increased snooping</a>, and some are starting to realize that it
is nasty.
</p>
<p>
However, it was nasty all along.Any "service" that is based
on discouraging or impeding people from having their own copies is a
scheme to interfere with sharing.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160313214751/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/08/21/spotify_worse_than_the_nsa/">
This article shows the twisted ways</a> that they present snooping as a
way to serve users better
&mdash; never mind whether they want that.  This is a typical
example of the attitude of the proprietary software industry
towards those they have subjugated.
</p>
<p>
Spotify 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/16/spotify-can-tell-if-youre-sad-heres-why-that-should-scare-you">can
tell whether users are happy or sad, based on what they listen to</a>.
It will use that data to manipulate them.  The data will sooner or
later be combined with other personal data, to control people
according to the corporate will.</p>
<p>
To protect yourself from this tracking, get an
actual copy of the song (or download it as an ogg or webm), and listen to it with free software. Then no
company will know what you are listening to.</p>
