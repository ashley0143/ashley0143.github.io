    <h1>Why You Should Think Twice Before Buying Intel</h1>
    <article>
      <section>
        <h2>1. Ongoing Stability Problems in Recent Desktop Chips</h2>
        <p>
          Intel’s 13th and 14th generation Core desktop processors (Raptor Lake and Raptor Lake Refresh) have been at the center
          of a long-running instability controversy. In 2024, Intel publicly acknowledged that elevated operating voltage caused
          by its own microcode algorithm was leading to system instability and potential CPU degradation on some 13th and 14th gen
          processors, forcing a global wave of BIOS and microcode updates for affected systems.*
        </p>
        <p>
          Real-world effects were not just theoretical: engineers at Mozilla reported large spikes in crash reports from systems
          running these chips, especially during heat waves in Europe, where timing and voltage issues appeared to become worse
          under higher temperatures. Users reported browser crashes, application instability and general unreliability, even on
          expensive “enthusiast” systems that were supposed to be high-end and robust.**
        </p>
        <p>
          While firmware updates can mitigate some of these problems, the bigger issue is trust: when you buy a brand-new CPU and
          motherboard, you do not expect months (or years) of debugging instability, microcode roulette and warranty worries just
          to get the platform into a stable state.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. A Long History of Serious Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <p>
          Intel processors have been hit by a long list of high-profile security vulnerabilities over the last decade. Meltdown,
          Spectre and related transient execution attacks showed that speculative execution could be abused to read data across
          security boundaries, forcing operating systems, hypervisors and browsers to add mitigations that sometimes reduced
          performance and increased complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          More recently, the <em>Downfall</em> vulnerability (Gather Data Sampling, CVE-2022-40982) targeted Intel’s 6th through
          11th generation Core CPUs and several generations of Xeon server parts. Downfall exploits the gather instruction in AVX
          to leak data from internal vector registers during speculative execution, potentially exposing sensitive information
          such as cryptographic keys from other processes running on the same core.***
        </p>
        <p>
          Another example, <em>Foreshadow</em> (also called L1 Terminal Fault), affects many modern Intel processors and can be
          used to read data from Intel SGX enclaves, virtual machines, OS kernels and system management memory under the right
          conditions. This effectively undermines the isolation guarantees these technologies are supposed to provide, and once
          again required broad software and firmware mitigations.****
        </p>
        <p>
          Security issues are not unique to Intel, but the sheer number and impact of speculative-execution vulnerabilities on
          modern Intel architectures has forced users, sysadmins and cloud providers into a constant cycle of patching and
          performance trade-offs.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Intel Management Engine: An Opaque, Always-On Subsystem</h2>
        <p>
          Almost all modern Intel platforms include the Intel Management Engine (ME), an autonomous subsystem running its own
          firmware inside the chipset. The ME has deep access to system memory and hardware and can remain active even when the
          main computer appears to be powered off, as long as the motherboard receives power.*****
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the ME firmware is proprietary and not under user control, privacy and security advocates have described it as
          a potential backdoor. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Libreboot developers and several security researchers have
          raised alarms about the ME’s ability to access memory and network interfaces independently of the main operating system,
          bypassing local firewalls and user control altogether.****** Intel denies that it is a backdoor, but the fact remains:
          users cannot easily inspect, replace or truly disable this subsystem on most Intel hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of design concerns, multiple serious vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ME over the years, including
          remotely exploitable privilege-escalation bugs that affected a huge range of systems from 2008 onward. These issues
          forced emergency firmware updates and, in some environments, led to efforts to partially neutralize the ME using
          unofficial methods just to reduce the attack surface.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Short-Lived Graphics Driver Support and Premature “Legacy” Status</h2>
        <p>
          In 2024–2025, Intel announced that integrated graphics on its 11th through 14th generation Core processors would be
          moved into a “legacy” support model. That means no more day-zero game optimizations or feature updates; instead, users
          get only quarterly driver releases focused on critical bug and security fixes.*******
        </p>
        <p>
          This decision effectively deprioritizes integrated GPUs that are still relatively new in the market. Some of these chips
          only launched in 2023 and 2024, yet Intel is already telling customers not to expect timely game support or meaningful
          improvements going forward. For users who bought a recent Intel system expecting decent long-term integrated-graphics
          support, this feels like a bait-and-switch.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, Intel is pushing its discrete Arc GPUs and upcoming architectures as the “real” gaming solution,
          which may be good for Arc as a brand but leaves owners of fresh 11th–14th gen iGPUs with a much weaker support story
          than they might have assumed when they purchased their hardware.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Platform Churn, Naming Confusion and Fragmented Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond specific bugs and vulnerabilities, Intel’s overall platform strategy can feel chaotic. Socket and chipset
          changes arrive frequently, sometimes giving only one or two CPU generations per socket before users are pushed to a new
          motherboard if they want to upgrade. That increases cost and electronic waste, especially compared with platforms where
          the same socket can support multiple generations of processors over a longer period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intel’s branding has also become more confusing over time. Instead of a clear, simple naming scheme, users have to
          navigate long strings of numbers and suffixes that mix desktop and mobile parts, “F” and “K” variants, and now new
          naming conventions for “Core Ultra” and beyond. For an average buyer, knowing what they are really getting (and how it
          compares to older generations) is harder than it should be.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you combine regular socket churn, complex segmentation and a habit of quickly pushing still-recent hardware into
          “legacy” support, it paints a picture of a company that prioritizes short upgrade cycles over long-term platform
          stability.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Why I Personally Avoid Intel</h2>
        <p>
          No company is perfect, and every hardware vendor ships bugs. But with Intel, the pattern over the last decade has been
          hard to ignore: serious speculative-execution vulnerabilities, opaque and powerful management subsystems, instability
          in recent desktop flagships, and a willingness to move new hardware into reduced-support “legacy” status very quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you care about long-term stability, transparent security and good support, it is completely reasonable to look at
          alternatives before buying an Intel-based system. Such as AMD.
