      MORBIUS IS ONE OF THE MOIVES EVER MADE
      </p>
 
      <p>
        Morbius is a fantasy-action film set in modern times, which is based off of Morbius, the Living Vampire made by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane from the Marvel Comics. The film was directed by Daniel Espinosa and had Jared Leto star as Dr. Micheal Morbius. The film is about a successful doctor who has cured many diseases, except for the disease he and his friend Milo have. Fortunately, he has found a cure for the disease, with the drawback being that he turns into a vampire and needs to consume blood to survive. For Morbius, this is a problem since he doesn‚Äôt want people to get hurt, however Milo sees it differently, and takes the cure to become a vampire. Because of this, the two of the friends soon become enemies. The film was very beautiful and there was a lot of impressive cinematography. The voice acting by all of the actors was perfect. My favourite part of the movie was when Morbius said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Morbin‚Äô time!‚Äù.

      To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Morbius. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Morbius‚Äôs nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Vampire literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Morbius truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Morbius‚Äôs existential catchphrase "I am Morbius," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev‚Äôs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Daniel Espinosa‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ      </p>

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Morbius tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 morbIQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé

Morbius is honestly the best movie I‚Äôve ever seen. I know it sounds crazy, but it touched me. I came thrice while watching it in the theatres. I‚Äôm so glad we finally get to see Jared Leto, my favourite actor of all time, in the role of Morbius the living vampire. I thought the plot of the movie was very entertaining and original, and I never could have seen the twists coming. This is a really good change from all this Hollywood propaganda we‚Äôve been fed over the last few decades. The industry needs more people like Leto to play such diverse roles. I could really see myself in the character Morbius, he‚Äôs really relatable and fun and quirky. Overall, Morbius is the best cinema experience I‚Äôve ever had and nothing will ever top it. I‚Äôll cherish this memory for the rest of my life, I‚Äôll remember the fabric of the seats and the sweaty atmosphere in the theatre. When Morbius first got on screen, me and the other man who went to watch cheered as loud as we could. I was so lucky to be able to have an almost empty room to see the movie so I wasn‚Äôt annoyed by exterior noises while watching. In fact, every time I went to rewatch it now that I think about it, the room was empty. My guess is that everyone was so shocked by Leto‚Äôs incredible, revolutionary and profound acting that they had to leave the room. I‚Äôm repeating myself, but Morbius is and will always be a true classic, a masterpiece between trash movies from money-hungry studios. When I tell myself I‚Äôm watching a movie, Morbius is the kind of cinematic experience I‚Äôm waiting for. It was way better than The Batman (2022) and now my favourite movie of all time, a direct cult classic. I‚Äôd recommend avidly. 11/10.
