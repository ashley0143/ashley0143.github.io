      <p>
        	      The Discord communications system
	      <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord.html">requires running</a> a
              <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">nonfree
	      client</a> program.  That alone is reason to refuse to
	      use it.
         
      </p>
      <p>
		The program reportedly collects lots of data about
		users.<br>  The developer denies the claim that
		Discord reports which processes are running on the
		user's machine.  I have no way of determining the
		facts about this specific point.  Whether it collects
		those particular data is a minor detail; I mention it
		only to avoid appearing to assert a criticism that
        might not be true.</p>
	      <p>
		For the same reason, I mention that selling personal
		data is not the sole way that the company makes
		money.<br>  I don't think that question how it makes
		money really matters.  What matters, ethically, is
		what the software does to users.  The developers'
		motives for making it do those things are pertinent to
		understanding the situation but should not affect our
		moral judgment of mistreatment of users.
      </p>
      		<p>
		  Discord may
		  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20791163">demand
		  to talk with you by phone if it decides you are
		  suspicious</a> &mdash; for instance, if you contact
		  it via Tor.
      </p>
      <p>
         Reportedly the Discord web app sends tracking data to /science instead of the usual /track, so as to thwart extensions to limit tracking. Reportedly there is a switch that disables (some) data collection, but it doesn't affect the sending of tracking data to the server. If you know of references for this information, please tell me.
