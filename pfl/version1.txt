                       Version 1, 28 March 2023

 Copyright (C) 2023 PokeTale Software  
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 
 Preamble

 The Poketale Free Software License is a free software license that is based on the four essential freedoms of free software. These freedoms include:

 -Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
 -Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
 -Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.
 -Freedom 3: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
    
 With these freedoms, the users (both individually and collectively) control the program and what it does for them. When users don't control the program, we call it a “nonfree” or “proprietary” program. The nonfree program controls the users, and the developer controls the program; this makes the program an instrument of unjust power.

 “Open source” is something different: it has a very different philosophy based on different values. Its practical definition is different too, but nearly all open source programs are in fact free. We explain the difference in Why “Open Source” misses the point of Free Software here: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html

 1. Definitions:

    "Software" means the original work of authorship made available under this license.
    
    "License" means this PokeTale Free Software License.
    
    "Commercial Use" means using the Software in any way that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation, including without limitation any use in connection with a business, trade, profession, or enterprise.
    
    "Contributor" means any person or entity that contributes to the Software. 
    
    “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.  Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.” We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.
